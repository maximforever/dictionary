        </span>
        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "1">Hackterms is a community-sourced dictionary of coding terms. Use it to quickly understand:
            <ul>
                <li>why, where, and when someone would use a tool/process/language</li>
                <li>what the pros, cons, and alternatives are</li>
                <li>where this term fits in within the coding ecosystem</li>
            </ul>

            Hackterms is not a holistic resource to learn to code - it will tell you <span class = "bold">why</span>, <span class = "bold">when</span>, and <span class = "bold">where</span> a certain term is used, but not <span class = "bold">how</span> to use it. Fortunately, lots of other resources on the web will teach you the ins-and-outs of any programming concept.

        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "2">Absolutely! The goal of Hackterms is to help  gets better with every new perspective added. Your definition might help a fellow developer understand the term better!

        <br><br> 

        All new submissions are reviewed within 24 hours. The goal of the review process is to make sure your submission is a good fit for Hackterms - that is is a coding term that aims to be constructive, objective, and not offensive. We do <span class = "bold">not</span> review submission for technical accuracy, but do review them for topical accuracy. For example, we will approve a definition that says React.js is a language (though this is technically incorrect), but not that it's a type of hamburger.</div>

        </span>
        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "3">Any term related to computer programming is great: tools, languages, processes, libraries, frameworks, data structures, algorithms, architecture, project management jargon, you name it!
            <br>
            <br>
        Naturally, programmers will have diverse opinions about the tools they use. We welcome these, as long as they are presented in an constructive way. Hackterms is not a good fit for non-coding terms (ex: "ramen: the lifeblood of budding developers"), or highly-objective terms

                <li>It is topically wrong: for example, it's fine to say React.js is a language (though this is technically incorrect), but not that it's a type of hamburger</li>

            Yes. Hackterms aims for simplicity and high-level understanding. We want you to understand the <span class = "bold">"why"</span>, <span class = "bold">"when"</span>, and <span class = "bold">"where"</span> of programming terminology - not the <span class = "bold">"how"</span>.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes this means sacrificing accuracy for the sake of readability. However, lots of other great resources on the web will provide in-depth dicussion of any programming topic.

        <div class = "faq-answer" data-id = "12">
            For me, the hardest thing about learning to code was connected the dots. I struggled with questions like: 

            <ul>
                <li>where does the the Ruby language end and the Rails framework begin?</li>
                <li>what is bower, vim, grunt, middleware, PostgreSQL, and which of these do I need to learn right now?</li>
                <li>are git and TDD crucial to getting my first website up and running?</li>
            </ul>

            This type of confusion resonated with my fellow devs, so I decided to create a community-sourced reference to help newcomers tackle these questions.
